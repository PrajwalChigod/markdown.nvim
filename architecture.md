# Architecture

This file is the map of the codebase. Read it before changing anything under
`lua/renderer/core/`, `handler/`, `render/` or `format/`.

How to read it:

- **Part 1 describes code that exists.** Every path, function and field named
  there is on `main`. If part 1 and the code disagree, the code is right and
  part 1 has a bug: fix it in the same change.
- **Part 2 describes code that does not exist yet.** Nothing named only in
  part 2 can be required, called or assumed. It is the agreed design for
  future work, to be followed when that work is done.
- When a part 2 design is implemented, move its text into part 1 in the same
  change and rewrite it in the present tense.
- Update part 1 when a change adds or moves a module, changes the lifecycle,
  or changes one of the rules below. Bug fixes and new options inside an
  existing block do not need an update.

# Part 1: how it works today

## What the plugin does

It makes a buffer easier to read without changing its text. A treesitter
parser reads the buffer, the plugin turns syntax nodes into extmarks (icons,
highlights, concealed characters, virtual lines), and neovim draws them. When
the cursor moves onto a line, the marks on that line are removed so the raw
text can be edited. Turning the plugin off removes every mark and the buffer
is exactly as it was.

It is built for markdown. HTML, LaTeX and YAML are handled because they appear
inside markdown. What the core needs to know about a file type is declared in
one place, a format, so that more file types can be added as files. Markdown
and plain HTML are the two formats today.

## The pipeline in one view

```text
buffer text
  -> treesitter parser          one tree per language, injections included
  -> handler (one per language) runs a query, each capture goes to a renderer
  -> renderer (one per capture) emits renderer.Mark values through `Marks`
  -> Extmark (one per mark)     stored on the buffer's Decorator
  -> display                    each extmark shown or hidden for the cursor
```

Everything else is support for this path: `core/manager.lua` decides which
buffers enter it, `core/ui.lua` decides when it runs, `format/` and
`lib/config.lua` decide how it is configured for a buffer.

## Vocabulary

These words have one meaning each in the code and in this file.

| Term      | Meaning                                                                    | Lives in                    |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| format    | Declaration of a file type: root language, parsers, handlers, defaults     | `format/<name>.lua`         |
| language  | A treesitter language. One buffer has a root language and injected ones    | from the parser             |
| handler   | Turns one language tree into marks: a query plus a capture to renderer map | `handler/<language>.lua`    |
| renderer  | Turns one captured node into marks. Has `setup()` and `run()`              | `render/<language>/*.lua`   |
| mark      | A `renderer.Mark`: a position plus extmark options, not yet applied        | `lib/marks.lua`             |
| extmark   | A mark wrapped so it can be shown and hidden                               | `lib/extmark.lua`           |
| decorator | Per buffer store of extmarks, plus the debounce timer and `changedtick`    | `lib/decorator.lua`         |
| context   | State for one parse of one buffer, discarded after                         | `request/context.lua`       |
| view      | The visible row ranges of a buffer. Only these are parsed and queried      | `request/view.lua`          |
| parse     | The expensive step: compute marks from the trees                           | `Updater:parse` in `ui.lua` |
| display   | The cheap step: show or hide stored extmarks for the cursor position       | `Updater:display`           |
| component | A per buffer config block such as `heading` or `html`                      | `settings.lua`              |

## Rules that must hold

Breaking one of these does not fail loudly. It produces wrong widths, stale
marks or generated files that drift.

1. **The buffer text is never changed.** Everything is extmarks in the
   namespace `ui.ns`. Turning the plugin off must leave the buffer as it was.
2. **Renderers never call the extmark API.** They add marks through the
   `Marks` helper (`self.marks:start`, `:over`, `:add`, `:replace`).
3. **The markdown handler runs last, latex just before it.** The order is set
   in `handlers.run`. Every other handler creates its marks with
   `Marks.new(context, true)`, which records what it conceals and what inline
   text it adds, so that markdown can measure real on screen widths. A new
   handler for a language that can appear inside markdown must pass `true`.
4. **The context lives for one parse.** Get it with `Context.get(buf)`. Do
   not keep state on it across passes, and do not cache it.
5. **Expensive work belongs in parse, not display.** Display runs on every
   cursor move.
6. **Nodes with a syntax error are skipped.** `View:nodes` drops any captured
   node where `has_error()` is true, so a renderer never sees one.
7. **A format is found by root treesitter language, never by filetype.**
8. **Two formats that name the same language must name the same handler
   module.** `format.handler` asserts it.
9. **Config starts in `settings.lua`.** `types.lua` and the config sections
   of `README.md` and `doc/renderer.txt` are generated by `just update`: do
   not edit them by hand. The `M.default` table in `init.lua` must stay a
   literal table, because `scripts/update.py` parses it.
10. **A new component is listed in three places:** its block in
    `settings.lua`, its line in `M.default` in `init.lua`, and its name in
    `Config.components` in `lib/config.lua`.
11. **Highlight groups are `Renderer*`,** defined in `core/colors.lua` as
    default links to standard groups, never as fixed colors.
12. **Neovim 0.12 is the minimum.** There is no compatibility layer, so use
    0.12 APIs directly.

## Lifecycle

### 1. Startup

`plugin/renderer.lua` runs once. It refuses neovim older than 0.12, then:

1. `require('renderer').setup(vim.g.renderer_config)` resolves the config:
   defaults, then the preset, then the user's table, merged in that order.
   Plugin managers differ in whether they call `setup` before or after the
   plugin directory loads, so `setup` ignores an empty call once it has been
   initialized.
2. `state.setup(config)` stores the global values and clears the per buffer
   config cache. It calls `core/ts.lua` to add configured treesitter
   injections and `core/ui.lua` to clear existing marks.
3. `colors.init()` defines the `Renderer*` highlight groups, each linked to a
   standard group.
4. `command.init()` creates `:Renderer`. `log.init()` picks the log file and
   arranges for buffered entries to be written on exit.
5. `manager.init()` registers a `FileType` autocmd for every buffer and a
   global `WinResized` autocmd.

### 2. Attach

`core/manager.lua` decides which buffers the plugin owns. On `FileType`,
`should_attach(buf)` rejects the buffer if it is already attached, invalid,
its filetype is not in `file_types`, its file is larger than `max_file_size`,
or the user's `ignore` function returns true.

For an accepted buffer it builds the buffer's config, calls the `on.attach`
callback, and runs one time setup (`state.attach`): disabling some treesitter
highlight patterns and starting the completion integration. It then registers
autocmds on that buffer for the events that can change what should be shown
(cursor movement, text changes, mode changes, scrolling, window enter), plus
the insert mode versions when rendering is enabled in insert mode. Each event
calls `ui.update(buf, win, event, force)`.

### 3. Update

`core/ui.lua` holds the render loop. `ui.update` creates an `Updater`:

```text
Updater:start   skip if buffer or window is gone
                debounce through the buffer's Decorator
Updater:run     read the mode
                render? = config.enabled
                          and the mode is a render mode
                          and the window is not scrolled sideways (leftcol == 0),
                              unless the buffer's format sets scroll
                          and not in diff mode (unless render.diff)
                set win_options to their 'rendered' or 'default' value
                render -> Updater:render, otherwise clear every mark
Updater:render  if forced, or the buffer changed, or the visible range is new:
                  parse, then replace the stored marks
                display
```

There are two separate steps, and the difference matters for performance:

- **Parse** computes marks. It is the expensive step and runs only when the
  buffer text changed (tracked with `changedtick`), the visible range moved
  outside what was computed, or the update was forced.
- **Display** decides which of the stored marks are shown right now. It runs
  on every update, including each cursor move, and is cheap.

### 4. Parse

```text
vim.treesitter.get_parser(buf)          no parser -> log an error, stop
Context.new(buf, win, config)           fresh state for this pass
view:parse(parser)                      parse only the visible ranges
handlers.run(context, parser)           -> renderer.Mark[]
Extmark.new for each mark               -> stored on the Decorator
```

The `View` (`request/view.lua`) is the set of row ranges visible in any window
showing the buffer, plus ten rows of padding. Only those ranges are parsed and
queried, which is what keeps large files fast.

### 5. Display

`Updater:display` works out the rows to leave raw: the cursor row plus
`anti_conceal.above` and `below`, or the selected rows in visual mode. For
each stored mark it calls `Updater:hide`, which hides a mark when its modes do
not include the current mode, or when it overlaps those rows and is
concealable. `anti_conceal.ignore` can keep chosen kinds of mark, such as
signs, visible on the cursor row.

`lib/decorator.lua` then shows or hides each extmark. It also handles
**replace marks**: a mark that hides whole lines and supplies virtual lines to
stand in for them, used by wrapped table rows. Neovim does not draw virtual
lines attached to a hidden row, so `lib/replacements.lua` moves them above the
next visible row.

## Handlers and renderers

`core/handlers.lua` walks every language tree in the buffer, including
injected ones, and keeps a tree when:

- there is a custom or builtin handler for its language. Builtin handlers
  are found through the format registry, required on first use and cached;
- nesting allows it: `nested` is true, or the tree has at most one markdown
  tree in its chain of ancestors. The count is 0 for a root tree of another
  language, such as `html` in a `.html` file, 1 for markdown or a language
  injected into it, and 2 or more for markdown nested in markdown. Only the
  last is what `nested = false` turns off;
- its root overlaps the view.

Trees are grouped by language and the languages run in a fixed order:
`markdown` last, `latex` just before it, every other language before those.
The order exists because of a dependency between handlers. The inline
handlers record what they conceal and what inline text they add into the
request context. The markdown handler runs last so that when it measures a
table cell or a heading, it knows the width the text will really have on
screen.

A handler has one function:

```lua
---@class renderer.Handler
---@field extends? boolean
---@field parse fun(ctx: renderer.handler.Context): renderer.Mark[]

---@class renderer.handler.Context
---@field buf integer
---@field root TSNode
---@field last boolean      true for the last tree of this language
```

Users can supply their own through `custom_handlers`, keyed by language. A
custom handler replaces the builtin one unless it sets `extends`.

Every builtin handler has the same shape: a treesitter query, a table from
capture name to renderer, and a loop.

| Handler                       | Captures and their renderers                                                               |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `handler/markdown.lua`        | code, dash, document, footnote, heading, list, paragraph, quote, section, table            |
| `handler/markdown_inline.lua` | code, highlight, link, shortcut                                                            |
| `handler/html.lua`            | comment, tag, doctype, entity, raw                                                         |
| `handler/yaml.lua`            | bullet, link                                                                               |
| `handler/latex.lua`           | no query: collects formula nodes, converts them with an external tool, emits virtual lines |

A renderer extends `render/base.lua` and implements two methods. `setup()`
reads config and returns false to skip the node. `run()` emits marks.
`Base:execute` creates an instance per node and returns what `setup()`
returned.

### HTML renderers

`handler/html.lua` runs for HTML inside markdown and for a whole `.html` file,
so its renderers fall in two groups. The `tag` capture goes to
`render/html/tag.lua`, which hides tags and applies the `html.tag` config, and
then to one element renderer chosen by tag name. Element renderers extend
`render/html/element.lua`, which resolves the tag name, start tag and end tag
and offers `alone` and `hide`: a tag alone on its lines is hidden with
`conceal_lines`, otherwise only the tag is concealed. Renderers that replace
lines with virtual lines (`head`, `raw`, `table`) also check `replaceable`,
which needs `conceallevel` 2 or more because Neovim does not hide lines below
that.

| Renderer in `render/html/` | Applies to                              | Group     | Switch                     |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------- | -------------------------- |
| `doctype.lua`              | `doctype`                               | structure | `html.structure`           |
| `page.lua`                 | `html`, `body`                          | structure | `html.structure`           |
| `head.lua`                 | `head`, shows the title                 | structure | `html.structure`           |
| `raw.lua`                  | `script`, `style` summaries             | structure | `html.structure`           |
| `list.lua`                 | `ul`, `ol`, `li`                        | block     | `html.list`, `bullet`      |
| `quote.lua`                | `blockquote`                            | block     | `html.quote`, `quote`      |
| `pre.lua`                  | `pre`                                   | block     | `html.pre`, `code`         |
| `rule.lua`                 | `hr`                                    | block     | `html.rule`, `dash`        |
| `table.lua`                | `table`, drawn from `pipe_table` config | block     | `html.table`, `pipe_table` |
| `heading.lua`              | `h1` to `h6`, `.html` file only         | structure | `heading`                  |
| `link.lua`                 | `a` with `href`                         | block     | `link`                     |
| `entity.lua`               | `entity`, decoded by `lib/entities.lua` | block     | `html.entity`              |

Structure renderers and `heading.lua` return false from `setup()` unless
`context.format.name == 'html'`, so a markdown buffer containing `<html>` or
`<body>` keeps those lines. Block renderers run wherever HTML appears and reuse
the config and highlights of their markdown counterparts. `html.tag` is not
extended: new element behaviour goes in its own renderer.

`table.lua` is built from the marks of what is inside its cells, so the
handler runs it after every other capture, once the inline marks exist. Those
marks only exist for rows in the view, which is why a table is drawn only when
`View:covers` says it lies fully inside. It reads cell text with
`lib/display.lua`, lays the grid out with the helpers of `parser/table.lua`
that markdown wrapped rows use, and replaces the whole element with one
`marks:replace`. A table it cannot draw (spans, a table inside a cell, an end
tag missing) is left as source.

## Formats

`lua/renderer/format/init.lua` is the registry, with one file per format next
to it. A format declares what the core needs to know about a file type:

```lua
---@class renderer.Format
---@field name string
---@field root string                        root treesitter language
---@field languages table<string, boolean>   treesitter language -> required
---@field handlers table<string, string>     treesitter language -> handler module
---@field defaults? renderer.partial.UserConfig
---@field scroll? boolean                    keep rendering when scrolled sideways
```

There are two formats, `markdown` and `html`:

```lua
-- format/markdown.lua
return {
    name = 'markdown',
    root = 'markdown',
    languages = {
        markdown = true,
        markdown_inline = true,
        html = false,
        latex = false,
        yaml = false,
    },
    handlers = {
        html = 'renderer.handler.html',
        latex = 'renderer.handler.latex',
        markdown = 'renderer.handler.markdown',
        markdown_inline = 'renderer.handler.markdown_inline',
        yaml = 'renderer.handler.yaml',
    },
}

-- format/html.lua
return {
    name = 'html',
    root = 'html',
    languages = { html = true },
    handlers = { html = 'renderer.handler.html' },
}
```

A format has exactly one root language. **Lookup is by root treesitter
language, not filetype.** `format.get(buf)` resolves
`vim.treesitter.language.get_lang(filetype)` and returns the format whose
`root` matches. Users list filetypes such as `rmd` or `codecompanion` in
`file_types` and map them to the markdown parser, and those resolve to
markdown. A root language with no format (`gitcommit` with its markdown
injection, or a `custom_handlers` only setup) returns nil: no defaults, and
the buffer still attaches and renders through whatever handlers exist.

Who reads it:

| Consumer              | Reads             | For                                              |
| --------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `core/handlers.lua`   | `handlers`        | the builtin handler for a language               |
| `request/context.lua` | the format itself | `context.format`, so a handler knows its host    |
| `lib/config.lua`      | `defaults`        | per buffer config, applied before the overrides  |
| `core/ui.lua`         | `scroll`          | whether to keep rendering when scrolled sideways |
| `health.lua`          | `languages`       | the parsers `:checkhealth` reports               |

The handler map is keyed by language and shared between formats.
`format.handler(language)` looks across all formats, and if two formats name
the same language they must name the same module; the registry asserts this.

No format sets `defaults` or `scroll` yet. They are there for the formats
planned in part 2. `context.format` is read by the HTML structure renderers.

## Marks

A renderer never calls the extmark API. It adds a `renderer.Mark` through the
`Marks` helper (`lib/marks.lua`):

```lua
---@class renderer.Mark
---@field modes? renderer.Modes          extra modes this mark shows in
---@field conceal boolean|string         hide on the cursor row? or a kind name
---@field start_row integer
---@field start_col integer
---@field opts vim.api.keyset.set_extmark
---@field replace? renderer.mark.Line[]  virtual lines standing in for hidden rows
```

`conceal` controls anti conceal. `true` means hide the mark near the cursor,
`false` means always show it, and a string names a kind (`'sign'`,
`'table_border'`, `'virtual_lines'`) that `anti_conceal.ignore` can keep
visible.

`Marks.new(context, update)` takes a flag. When it is true, each mark is also
recorded in the request context (what it conceals, what inline text it adds).
The inline, HTML, YAML and LaTeX handlers set it. The markdown handler does
not, since it runs last and nothing reads its marks.

## Request context

`request/context.lua` is created fresh for each parse and thrown away after.
Handlers reach it with `Context.get(buf)`.

| Field        | Holds                                                                    |

## Configuration

`settings.lua` is the source of truth. Each block has a `default` table, type
annotations and a `schema()` function. `init.lua` assembles the blocks into
`M.default`. `lib/config.lua` keeps one list of block names,
`Config.components`, and builds both the per buffer config and its schema
from it. `scripts/update.py` reads both files to generate `types.lua` and
the config sections of the README and vimdoc, so config changes start in
`settings.lua` and are followed by `just update`.

Config values are of two kinds:

- **Global** (`renderer.state.Config`): `file_types`, `max_file_size`,
  `nested`, `injections`, `custom_handlers` and similar. Stored on
  `state.lua`.
- **Per buffer** (`renderer.partial.Config`): `enabled`, `render_modes`, and
  every rendering block such as `heading`, `code`, `html`. Built by
  `lib/config.lua` the first time a buffer is seen and cached.

The per buffer config starts from the root config, applies the `defaults` of
the buffer's format, and then applies `overrides` in this order, later ones
winning: `buflisted`, `buftype`, `filetype`, `preview` (for the preview
buffer), then any config passed to `api.render`. This is how hover windows,
which are `nofile` buffers, get different settings from files. A preview
buffer uses the format of its source buffer, as it does for the overrides.
Format `defaults` are applied on top of the user's top level config, so a
user can only change a value that a format sets through `overrides`.

`:checkhealth renderer` validates the whole config against the schemas. It
reports the parsers of every format reachable from `file_types`: the required
ones, then the optional ones whose config block is enabled. A language that
is required by one format and optional in another is reported as required.

| Change how an existing node renders       | its renderer under `render/`                                                                                |
| Add an option to an existing component    | type, default and schema in `settings.lua`, then `just update`                                              |

| Add a highlight group                     | `M.colors` in `core/colors.lua`, and the highlight table in `README.md`                                     |
| Add a `:Renderer` subcommand              | a function in `api.lua`, `core/command.lua` picks it up                                                     |
| Support a language injected into a format | `languages` and `handlers` in the format file, new `handler/<language>.lua` (rule 3)                        |
| Add a format                              | `format/<name>.lua`, its name in `M.names` in `format/init.lua`, a handler for its root language            |
| Change when rendering is on or off        | `Updater:run` in `core/ui.lua`                                                                              |

| Change what the cursor row reveals        | `Updater:hidden` and `Updater:hide` in `core/ui.lua`                                                        |

A new renderer has this shape:

```lua
local Base = require('renderer.render.base')

---@class renderer.render.html.Comment: renderer.Render
---@field private config renderer.html.Config
local Render = setmetatable({}, Base)
Render.__index = Render

---@protected
---@return boolean
function Render:setup()
    self.config = self.context.config.html
    return true -- false skips the node
end

---@protected
function Render:run()
    -- self.node, self.context and self.marks are set by Base:execute
    self.marks:over(self.config, true, self.node, { conceal = '' })
end

return Render
```

Every user facing change also needs a spec (see Tests) and a line under
`## Pre-release` in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Other parts

- **Commands.** Every function in `api.lua` is a `:Renderer` subcommand,
  generated in `core/command.lua`. `render` is callable from Lua only.
- **Preview.** `core/preview.lua` opens a side split with a read only copy of
  the buffer that stays rendered, and turns rendering off in the source so it
  can be edited raw. Lines, cursor and events are mirrored across.
- **Completions.** `integ/` offers callout and checkbox completions through
  an in process LSP server or a completion plugin.
- **External tools.** Only LaTeX uses one. `handler/latex.lua` starts the
  converter for each formula with `vim.system` and waits for it to exit
  inside the render pass, with results cached by formula text.
- **Logging.** `core/log.lua` writes to a file under `stdpath('state')` at the
  configured level.
- **Debug.** `:Renderer debug` lists the marks on the cursor row,
  `:Renderer config` prints the difference from the defaults.

## Tests

Specs are plenary busted files under `tests/`, with unit specs for single
modules under `tests/unit/`. `tests/minimal_init.lua` loads the dependencies,
installs the parsers, and starts the treesitter highlighter for `markdown` and
`html` buffers. `benches/` holds timing specs for larger files.

A render spec sets up a scratch buffer and asserts two things: the exact list
of marks, and the text on screen.

```lua
local util = require('tests.util')

it('inline bold', function()
    -- lines, config, filetype (defaults to 'markdown')
    local config = { file_types = { 'markdown', 'html' } }
    util.setup.text({ '<b>bold</b>' }, config, 'html')
    local marks = util.marks()
    -- row or { start_row, end_row }, col or { start_col, end_col }, extmark opts
    marks:add({ 0, 0 }, { 0, 3 }, util.conceal())
    marks:add({ 0, 0 }, { 3, 7 }, { hl_eol = false, hl_group = 'RmHtmlBold' })
    marks:add({ 0, 0 }, { 7, 11 }, util.conceal())
    util.assert_view(marks, { 'bold' })
end)
```

In expected marks the `Renderer` prefix of a highlight group is written `Rm`.
`tests/helpers/details.lua` shortens the actual names the same way.

Run one file with `PlenaryBustedDirectory` and the minimal init, as shown in
`CLAUDE.md`. `PlenaryBustedFile` skips the minimal init and every render spec
fails. A spec for a filetype other than `markdown` or `html` needs that
filetype added to the highlighter autocmd in `tests/minimal_init.lua`.

## Where the code assumes markdown

The format registry removed the assumptions that sat in the handler table,
the config block lists, the sideways scroll check and the health check. These
remain, and each is addressed by a planned change in part 2.

| Where                              | Assumption                                              | Effect on other formats                           |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `core/ui.lua` `Updater:parse`      | the buffer has a treesitter parser                      | binary files cannot enter the pipeline            |
| `core/manager.lua` `should_attach` | the buffer text is the file on disk, for the size check | a large PDF is refused although its text is small |
| `handler/latex.lua`                | external tools are waited on inside the render pass     | unusable for anything slower than a formula       |
| `tests/util.lua`, `minimal_init`   | highlighter started for markdown and html only          | a spec for another filetype needs `minimal_init`  |

# Part 2: planned design (not implemented)

Nothing in this part exists in the code. Do not require these modules or rely
on these fields. When one of them is built, follow the design here and move
its section into part 1.

The goal is to render more than markdown: CSV, diagrams inside markdown, and
documents that are not text (DOCX, PDF). The format registry and plain HTML
files, described in part 1, are done. Two components remain:

| Component     | Module                          | Built together with its first user |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Job runner    | `lua/renderer/lib/job.lua`      | mermaid diagrams                   |
| Convert layer | `lua/renderer/convert/init.lua` | DOCX files                         |

## Principles

1. Keep the handler seam. New formats are new handlers, not a new pipeline.
2. One declaration per format. Whatever the core needs to know about a format
   it reads from that declaration.
3. One way to run an external tool: asynchronous, cached, argv only.
4. A file that is not text is converted into a read only buffer. The original
   is never written.
5. Nothing is downloaded. Parsers and tools are installed by the user and
   reported by `:checkhealth`.
6. Markdown users see no change. The existing specs are the proof.

## Two models

**A. Decorate in place.** The buffer holds the file's text, a parser reads it,
a handler emits marks. Editable, anti conceal works. Cannot reflow. Used for
HTML, CSV, TSV, PSV, and markdown itself.

**B. Convert, then decorate.** A tool turns the file into markdown, the result
goes into a read only buffer, the markdown format renders it. No new renderers.
Used for DOCX, PDF, the HTML reader view, and later ODT, EPUB, notebooks.

A third case sits inside a document rather than being one: **converted
blocks**. A node's text is sent to a tool and the output is shown in its place.
LaTeX formulas work this way now, mermaid diagrams will.

## Additions to the format registry

The registry itself is in place and described in part 1. The planned formats
add to it:

- **`scroll` and `defaults` get their first user with CSV.** The same grammar
  family differs only in its root, so `csv`, `tsv` and `psv` are separate
  formats built by one shared function.

  ```lua
  -- format/csv.lua
  return {
      name = 'csv',
      root = 'csv',
      languages = { csv = true },
      handlers = { csv = 'renderer.handler.csv' },
      scroll = true,
      defaults = {
          win_options = { wrap = { default = vim.o.wrap, rendered = false } },
      },
  }
  ```

- **A `source` field for model B**, read by `convert/init.lua`:

  ```lua
  ---@class renderer.Format
  ---@field source? renderer.format.Source     model B only

  ---@class renderer.format.Source
  ---@field patterns string[]                  BufReadCmd patterns, e.g. '*.docx'
  ---@field config string                      key under `convert` holding converters
  ---@field takeover? fun()                    remove a competing BufReadCmd
  ---@field decorate? fun(buf: integer)        one time marks for text output
  ```

- **`health.lua` reports converters** from the registry, as it does parsers.

## Job runner

`lua/renderer/lib/job.lua`. The only place that starts a process.

```lua
---@class renderer.job.Request
---@field cmd string[]
---@field stdin? string
---@field timeout? integer
---@field key? string            extra text mixed into the cache key
---@field disk? boolean          also cache under stdpath('cache')/renderer/

---@class renderer.job.Result
---@field ok boolean
---@field stdout string
---@field stderr string

---Returns the cached result when there is one, otherwise starts the job and
---returns nil. The callback runs once, on the main loop.
---@param request renderer.job.Request
---@param callback fun(result: renderer.job.Result)
---@return renderer.job.Result?
function M.run(request, callback) end
```

How a handler uses it during a render:

```text
render pass 1:  job.run(...) -> nil      emit nothing special, node renders raw
                  ... tool finishes ...
                callback: ui.update(buf, win, 'Job', true)
render pass 2:  job.run(...) -> result   emit marks from result.stdout
```

- Cache key is a hash of `cmd`, `stdin` and `key`. For file conversion `key`
  carries path, mtime and size.
- A request already in flight for the same key is joined, not restarted.
- Failures are cached, otherwise a broken input would start a process on every
  render. They clear when the input changes, since the key changes with it.
- A cap on concurrent processes, so a document with fifty diagrams does not
  start fifty at once.
- `ui.update` already checks the buffer and window are still valid, so a
  callback arriving after the buffer closed is harmless.

Consumers, in the order they arrive: mermaid, the convert layer, then LaTeX,
which can drop its blocking wait and its dead `vim.fn.system` branch.

## Convert layer

`lua/renderer/convert/init.lua`. Turns a file that is not text into a buffer
the pipeline can render.

```text
setup            for each format with a source, enabled, converter installed:
                   takeover(), then BufReadCmd on its patterns
BufReadCmd       placeholder line -> job.run(converter, disk = true)
  on success     set lines, lock the buffer, set filetype
  on failure     show the command and stderr in the buffer
FileType         manager.attach, the normal pipeline from here
```

The buffer contract:

| Property     | Value                | Why                                            |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| name         | the real file path   | `:e`, buffer lists and pickers behave normally |
| `buftype`    | `nowrite`            | `:w` cannot overwrite the binary with text     |
| `modifiable` | false                | nothing to edit                                |
| `swapfile`   | false                | no swap file next to a PDF                     |
| `filetype`   | `markdown` or `text` | set by the converter's `output`                |

`buftype = 'nowrite'` is the safety property of the whole feature and gets its
own spec. It also gives converted buffers a config hook for free:
`overrides.buftype.nowrite` gets a default of `render_modes = true` and
`anti_conceal` off, using the override mechanism that exists already.

Each converter declares its `output`. `markdown` buffers go through the
markdown format. `text` buffers do not: `pdftotext -layout` output parsed as
markdown would turn every indented line into a code block. Text buffers are
decorated once at load by the format's `decorate` function in the convert
layer's own namespace (page separators, page numbers), which is safe because
the buffer cannot change. This is why no non-treesitter path is added to the
render loop.

A format is registered only when one of its converters is installed. Without
pandoc, `.docx` keeps opening in the zip browser as it does today.

`should_attach` uses the size of the converted text for these buffers.

## Converted blocks

A pattern on top of the job runner, not a module of its own. A renderer that owns a
node sends its text through `job.run`:

- hit: replace the node's lines with the output as virtual lines, using the
  replace mark described in part 1, so the source returns when the cursor
  enters the block;
- miss: render the node as it would render without this feature;
- failure: same as miss, with the stderr logged.

Mermaid is the first user. Its renderer returns false from `setup()` on a miss
or a failure, and the markdown handler falls back to the code block renderer.
With `vim.ui.img` the same pattern produces an image instead of text, and only
the converter and the mark change.

## Module map after the planned work

```text
lua/renderer/
  format/            ADD   csv.lua, mermaid.lua, docx.lua, pdf.lua
  lib/job.lua        NEW   external tool runner
  convert/init.lua   NEW   BufReadCmd, buffer contract, text decoration
  core/reader.lua    NEW   HTML reader view
  core/manager.lua   CHG   size check for converted buffers
  health.lua         CHG   converters from registry
  handler/, render/  ADD   csv and mermaid handlers
  settings.lua       ADD   csv, mermaid, convert, reader blocks
```

`init.lua` keeps its literal `default` table, because `scripts/update.py`
parses it.

## Recipes once the planned work exists

**In place format** (CSV as the example):

1. `format/csv.lua`, and its name in the list in `format/init.lua`.
2. `handler/csv.lua`: a query and a capture to renderer map.
3. `render/csv/*.lua`: renderers extending `render/base.lua`.
4. A `csv` block in `settings.lua` with types and schema, its name in the
   component list, and its line in `init.lua` `default`.

**Converted format** (DOCX as the example):

1. `format/docx.lua` with a `source`, and its name in `format/init.lua`.
2. Converters under `convert.docx` in `settings.lua`.

**Converted format using a tool already supported** (ODT through pandoc): a
config entry.

**Converted block**: a config block with a `converter` list, and a call to
`job.run` in the renderer that owns the node.

None of the recipes edits `core/` or `health.lua`, and `lib/config.lua` only
gains a name in `Config.components`. If one ever has to do more, the registry
is missing a field and the fix belongs there.

## Testing the new parts

- Format specs use `tests/util.lua` `setup.text` with a filetype, and live in
  their own files that leave the markdown specs alone. `minimal_init` starts
  the highlighter for each new format's filetype.
- `lib/job.lua` and `convert/` are tested with trivial commands that print a
  fixture, so cache, sharing, failure, timeout and the `:w` guard are covered
  with no external tool installed.
- One real fixture spec per converter, skipped when the tool is absent. CI
  installs `pandoc` and `poppler-utils`.

## Alternatives rejected

- **A non-treesitter handler path** for CSV or PDF text. It would fork the
  render loop. The treesitter CSV grammars and the load time decoration of
  read only text buffers make it unnecessary.
- **A registry keyed by filetype.** Breaks filetypes that users map onto the
  markdown parser.
- **CSV converted to a markdown table.** Loses editing, which is the point of
  the in place model.
- **A dedicated filetype for converted buffers.** It would need the markdown
  parser registered for it and the highlighter started by hand, and gains
  only the ability to tell the buffers apart, which `buftype` already gives.
- **Downloading parsers or tools on demand.** Bypasses the user's plugin
  manager, fails offline, supply chain risk.
- **Building the job runner and convert layer before their first user.** Their
  interfaces would be guesses.

## Not verified

- How the treesitter `csv` grammars parse a quoted field containing a newline,
  and whether an empty field produces a node.
- That `markdown` as the filetype of a converted buffer causes no trouble with
  common markdown ftplugins and language servers. `buftype = 'nowrite'` should
  keep servers from attaching, to be confirmed with the convert layer.
- lazy.nvim replaying `BufReadCmd` after loading the plugin on a pattern
  event.
- How the cursor moves into a block whose lines are hidden by a replace mark
  spanning several rows.
- `vim.ui.img` function signatures.
